### Reentrancy attack on a smart contract

This is an (simplified) example of a reentrancy attack on a smart contract.

Update the pragma solidity directive to match your current compiler version.

Run the truffle compiler to make sure the current compiler does not have  
any issues with the solidity syntax used for the smart contracts. 
```
$ truffle compile
```

In terminal, start ganache-cli and run the tests
```
$ ./run-ganache-cli.sh
$ ./run-tests.sh
```
